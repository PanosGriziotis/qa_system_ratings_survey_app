This survey complements my master's [thesis](https://github.com/PanosGriziotis/thesis-QA-subsystem) and is designed to evaluate responses to user queries across multiple aspects, including completeness, factual accuracy, and overall usefulness. Participants will rate each response using Likert-scale scores ranging from 1 to 5.

The survey application is built using the Flask framework and Survey.js library.

To run the survey, a virtual environment is required to install the dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.

To test locally simply run:
$ python app.py

and access from your browser: http://0.0.0.0:portnumber (portnumber specified in app.py)
